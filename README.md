UPDATE: Server development is active again, resulting in this repository getting private in the next days.

The VC:MP server I was struggling to finish for 5 years. There's a total of 7 rewrites, and this is the lastest version ever. 

I released this, since I didn't open VC:MP for ~4 entire months. And I'm not going to support any of my VC:MP servers anymore. Oh, VC:MP is going to die for sure in the next 5 years.

I'll repeat myself: I'll promise that there is never going to be further support of this server.
Some noob players wanted their hands on this server, so there I am, making em' a favour.

The other owner Angelo22, since he's unable to play VC:MP again, since yeah, like sucks, he won't realise that I released the server he also owned.

If you download this piece of sh!t server, I warn you that it is going to crash every 20 minutes. It's here for you just to take a look.

I want to thank the VC:MP community for properly introducing me to programming 5 years 
ago.
